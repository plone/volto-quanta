# Quanta Design System - Volto Add-on

Quanta is the (new) design system for Volto by Albert Casado (@albertcasado). You can think on it as Pastanaga UI 2.0

Quanta is quite more than some aesthetics changes in Pastanaga UI, it comprises from a complete Widget redesign (control forms, etc) to buttons, toolbar, etc and their related UX.

Quanta will also address some known Pastanaga UI issues.

**This package is experimental and in their first stages of development. Its form, internal structure and features might change without further notice. This will be true since it's noted otherwise.**

## Rationale

The idea to start with a Volto add-on is because the change can't happen overnight, since that many things have to be refactored, tested, and delivered. So using a branch is off the table. Volto Add-ons deliver today all what we need to make the development of Quanta in approachable bits, then give the ability to test drive it both in project development and even in production. Volto's extensibility (by using the component registry) and component shadowing feature makes that extremely easy for Widgets and other components to switch to the next version of a given component, contained in this add-on.

## Features

We need Quanta to be accessible by default, so we need to put effort into make it possible.

It should match the new Quanta design system, pixel perfect if possible ðŸ™‚

## A new paradigm

We cannot improve SemanticUI (at least not easily), to include the missing accessibility features. Using SemanticUI in Volto in the beginning was good as we have a good swiss knife toolkit and components pool to quickly use it in a project or in Volto itself. However, it's huge (both in JS and in CSS) and the resultant bundle size is quite big because of it.

SemanticUI theming engine proved to be good but overwhelming for newbies. Even experienced frontend developers end up in relying in good old plain CSS using the `custom.overrides` facility to theme their projects.

There's a current goal to separate the Themed UI from the CMSUI (management views/engine), so they are independent and can be themed (and delivered) separately. Themed UI should be possible to use any CSS or JS Framework out there, without having the burden to still have SemanticUI because some element in Volto uses it.

## Roadmap

- Widgets
- Buttons
- Toolbar
- Blocks Engine UX/UI
- Add menu
- Add block menu
- Sidebar UX/UI

## Experimental branch

There was some work done experimenting with using a `CSS-in-JS` approach using `emotion` and `theme-ui`. It has been dropped for now, but you can find it in the branch: theme-ui
